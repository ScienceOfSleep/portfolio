Now retired. Design was inspired by a cool Behance concept board https://www.behance.net/gallery/60511787/Weather-Geolocation-App. 

It was unique but got feedback from a few sources that my take managed to be bland at the same time. Lesson learned, minimalism is tough and probably isn't a great fit for what should be a tech demo. 
  
Blog publishing didn't fit into my knowledge management system the way I'd hoped it would.

Using cool unsplash photos as centerpieces made adding my own graphic design work after the fact disrupt the theme. 

Finally, the copy wasn't focused on any one task. If it's a resume site then pitching contract work wastes space, as does fun content for people who I'm not asking for money in exchange for services. Sure personality still has a place, but I'd prefer to split into 3 focuses for personal, contract, and resume sites.

So there isn't much to keep moving forward. Was a great starter site and I learned a lot, so I'll keep this up as a record and reminder.
