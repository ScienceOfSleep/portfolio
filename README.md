Now retired. Design was inspired by a cool Dribble shot I've since lost. It was unique but got feedback from a few sources that it managed to be bland at the same time. Lesson learned, minimalism probably isn't a great fit for what should be a tech demo. 
  
Blog publishing didn't fit into my knowledge management system the way I'd hoped it would.

Using cool unsplash photos as centerpieces made adding my own graphic design work after the fact disrupt the theme. 

Finally, the copy wasn't focused on any one task. If it's a resume site then pitching contract work wastes space, as does fun content for people who I'm not asking for money in exchange for services. Sure personality still has a place, but I'd prefer to split into 3 focuses for personal, contract, and resume sites.

So there isn't much to keep moving forward. Was a great starter site and I learned a lot, so I'll keep this up as a record and reminder.

The goal was to create a proof-of-concept headless CMS that doubled as a personal portfolio site and blog. Incorporating the best parts of the cutting edge of modern web-design while retaining a client friendly user interface through the WordPress API. Responsive, mobile first design which places a heavy emphasis on efficiently shipping only the necessary information to the users device.
